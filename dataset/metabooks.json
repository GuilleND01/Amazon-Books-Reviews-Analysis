    "Explosion of color, drama of form, and juxtaposition of texture and contour best describe the jewelry of the Art Deco period, and Raulet has captured it all. Beginning with the \"Birth of Art Deco,\" jewelry is put in context with early 20th-century art movements and its development traced along with its renowned creators. Abundant illustrations of fine examples of various popular motifs from the African, Egyptian, and Oriental to themes of fantasy and the world of the machine makes it easy to see the quality craftsmanship that prevailed. Included are eight chapters on topics ranging from influences on jewelry to haute joaillerie and costume jewelry. Brief biographies of eminent designers conclude the volume. Highly recommended.

    "This massive and exhaustive study, generally considered to be the major work on the artist, was originally published in 1984, and has been out of print for 10 years. With 880 illustrations (230 in color) and a new preface, the volume arrives in time for the blockbuster Matisse-Picasso exhibit, currently hanging in Paris and opening in New York in February 2003. While the book has not been re-set, and its newspaper column-like typestting looks boxy and old-fashioned in the age of Quark and Photoshop, the font and lay-out seem appropriate to this book's old-school \"appreciation\" approach-Schneider starts with particular works, and lets them guide his observations about Matisse's life, surroundings, and ways of working. The result-17 years in preparation, weighing in at 8 1/2 pounds-brings Matisse (1869-1954) and his work into focus with energy and a non-intrusive judiciousness, from early still lives to the stark near color-field-like work of The Conversation (1911) and The Piano Lesson (1916) to the late paper cut-outs including Acrobats (1952). The book's original preface explains Schneider's own working methods (Schneider's new preface is mostly concerned with correcting his earlier version of Matisse's turn to his late style), but it can't quite account for the depth of understanding he is able to convey throughout. Those with serious Matisse fixations will have to pry open their wallets for this one, as it remains essential. <BR>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.",

    "Chocophiles will sigh in anticipation of glimpsing the dreamy dark desserts pictured in this sleekly illustrated work. Captured in shades of cocoa chiaroscuro to deep espresso are easy-to-make standards such as chocolate pots de creme and chocolate mousse. But the ultimate pleasure of chocolate for chef Desaulniers ( The Trellis Cookbook ) lies in the layering of flavors. The richest, most decadent desserts involve melding flavors of hazelnut, pistachio, pecans, espresso, raspberry, rum, brandy and other ingredients--even humble peanut butter--with chocolate. Chapters are organized by degree of obsession, from \"Singular Sensations\" and \"Simply Chocolate\" to the final chapter, \"Chocolate Dementia.\" Yet one doesn't have to be crazed to tackle these recipes. Desaulniers shows, in simple steps (right down to the equipment list), how to murder one's diet with a dose of \"Chocolate Demise,\" \"Chocolate Devastation\" or \"Double Mocha Madness.\" Clear instructions, exquisite color photographs, the author's refreshing sense of humor and his gentility in acknowledging contributions from other pastry chefs combine to elevate this cookbook over many others specializing in chocolate. <BR>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc."

    "Photography as a fine art is often shaped by work done in the field of fashion. As well as peddling clothes in the pages of women's magazines, fashion photographers also influence and reflect society's attitudes and obsessions. Thus, the elegant, chic, and sophisticated fashion images of the postwar period gradually evolved into the decadent, soft-porn statements typical of the 1980s and 1990s. Art historian Harrison discusses the sociological issues behind these photographic trends by examining not only the impact made by fashion photographers but also the influence of certain powerful and creative art directors. In addition, he covers the often overlooked area of male fashion, attempting to explain why this subject has received such little serious attention.The author does well in identifying the models used in each fashion shot. (Most of us have forgotten that Anjelica Huston also worked as a model.) Unfortunately, there is little new material in this book--little that was not covered in the same author's Shots of Style (Faber & Faber, 1986), written as an exhibition catalog for the Victoria and Albert Museum in 1985. Although neither book is indexed (which makes anthologies of this size difficult to use), the earlier work lists the photographers alphabetically in the table of contents, while the present work does not, merely offering such vague chapter headings as \"Inside\" and \"White Heat.\" Chicago readers will be disappointed that Victor Skrebneski's work is not included. Superfluous if your library has Shots of Style .<BR><I>- Margarete Gross, Chicago P.L.</I><BR>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc."

    "Opulent paintings illustrate a mythical tale of love and freedom in this unusual but ultimately unsuccessful picture book. A wordy text tells how Falcon has imprisoned Nightingale so that she will sing to him and relieve his sadness. Yet, unhappy in her cage, Nightingale can sing only one melancholy melody until the Wind offers her freedom. In an operatic face-off, Falcon learns to accept Nightingale's independence and a new era of love descends on the world. There is little in the way of plot, and the concerns of the text--the nature of love and freedom--are not developed with sufficient imagination to maintain the interest of most readers. Newcomer Silin-Palmer's ornate artwork follows the melodramatic narrative with a range of compositions, from baroque still lifes spilling grapes and foxgloves, to wispy pastels, to a full-spread formal portrait of animals in Shakespearean attire. The artist's impressive attention to detail and the dapperly dressed animals are enjoyable, but the overall effect of the volume is overblown and even garish. Ages 8-up. <BR>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.",
    "Kindergarten-Grade 3-Mandelstein updates Hans Christian Andersen's The Nightingale by changing the emperor into a falcon and tossing in huge doses of New Age philosophy. The Wind, represented as a mystical lion that looks more like a cloud formation than anything else, offers to help free the Nightingale, but only if the Nightingale \"truly wants\" its freedom. Later the Wind tells the angry Falcon, \"...it is not I who created the pain that you feel-it was there deep inside you before I arrived.\" And finally, the Wind offers the raptor these words of advice: \"Until you practice giving love, you will not receive love.\" Of course, the Falcon frees the Nightingale, whose beautiful sad song turns into a beautiful happy song. The illustrations of the birds in Renaissance-styling clothing and other animals, done in oils, are unappealing, at times even bordering on the repulsive. The wordy text is sometimes difficult to read since it is occasionally slapped on over the illustrations. Skip this didactic and poorly designed book.<BR><I>George Delalis, formerly at Oakland Public Library, CA</I><BR>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc."

    "When Crown Prince Gustaf returned from Versailles in 1771 to ascend the throne of Sweden, he was determined to give his country a leading place in Europe culturally as well as politically. The style he fostered -- Neoclassicism -- was itself an international movement; there are echos in the interiors displayed here of the Louis XVI and Empire modes. Pieces of furniture may reflect French, English, or German influences, or be copied from objects discovered at Pompeii -- but all are suffused by a distinctively Swedish freshness and the northern light.",
    "From royal salons to modest spatter-painted Biedermeier halls, Hakan Groth and Fritz von der Schulenburg open the doors on an astonishing sequence of interiors; some, intensely private, are little known even in Sweden. The evocative photographs, all specially taken for this book, present in detail the decoration and furnishings of twenty houses and apartments. The text traces the evolution of the Neoclassical style in Sweden, placing it in its wider European context, and explores each of the buildings and its history. Plans, and original drawings by the architects and designers, complete the picture.",
    "These beautiful interiors are of unique value today not only as treasure houses of superb craftsmanship but also as a stimulus to contemporary decorators, and as a reminder that an international language can be spoken in a delightfully personal way.",

    "The man behind the slogan \"If you don't look good, we don't look good\" is celebrated in this account of his phenomenal hairdressing career. Working in beauty salons since the age of 14, Sassoon developed innovative hairstyling techniques, treating hair as fabric to be cut to suit individual bone structure. He told his own story in Sorry I Kept You Waiting , Madam ( LJ 6/15/68) and coauthored A Year of Beauty and Health (1975) with his wife then, Beverly. This update on his legacy includes the 1984 Olympic Collection, the Punk influence, and Sassoon's vision for Nineties hair. Included is a decade-by-decade chronology of Sassoon fashion collaborations, cuts, perms, color techniques, salons, academies, product developments, promotions, publications, and media events, plus a glossary of hairstyling terms. Indispensable for fashion history collections and recommended for libraries where interest is strong.<BR><I>- Therese Duzinkiewicz Baker, Western Kentucky Univ.

    "This survey of America's stately homes is a coffee-table book par excellence. It is divided into three sections: the Agrarian South, the Industrial North, and the Frontier West (everything west of the Hudson River, that is). An introductory text to each section summarizes the political, social, and cultural forces that enabled the building of these opulent mansions. The excellent color photographs include both interior and exterior views, and, of necessity, give only a taste of the treasures to be found in these 53 houses. All the homes are maintained in period style, and many are open to the public. While not a necessary purchase for many libraries, this book will provide readers with a tantalizing glimpse into a way of life that even in its time was experienced by only a few. Recommended for public libraries.<BR><I>- Constance Ashmore Fairchild, Univ. of Illinois Lib., Urbana-Champaign</I><BR>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.",
    "Although the elegant color photographs by Paul Rocheleau--interior and exterior views of where and how the rich and famous lived in the nineteenth-century U.S.--will he admired by readers, the text is also to be commended. Former <i>Antiques</i> magazine editor Garrett has chosen no small task in describing the intellectual, social, historical, and design mindsets of the U.S. in the 1800s. He sets the stage, then, for tracing, via the photos, the hodgepodge of architectural styles existing in the country at that time. More than 50 homes and mansions--some famous (Andrew Jackson's Hermitage, for example), others simply big and costly--are profiled, with accompanying blurbs on furnishings and construction. Most are now public places (addresses are listed in the appendix). For larger design and architectural collections. <i>Barbara Jacobs</i>"
